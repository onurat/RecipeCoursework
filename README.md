You will be starting from scratch a new website project:

EXPECTATION: Create a new recipe page for your favourite meal and how to make it and where it comes from making sure you put into practice the techniques learnt throughout the week. 

This website should be source controlled with git and needs to have clear branching strategy.


## Requirements
Submitting your work
- Remember to commit and push your code often.
- Get your colleagues/Volunteers to review prs to main as often during the week and use Saturday as an opportunity to improve website
